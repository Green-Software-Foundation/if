# CSV Import Plugin

`csv-import` is a versatile plugin that allows you to extract specific data from a CSV file and seamlessly integrate it into the `input` data of your manifest file.

You provide path to the target csv file. The file path can reference either a local file on your system or a URL pointing to an online resource.

For example, for the following CSV:

|      |                |                 |            |            |              |           |                  |            |            |                        |            |                            |                                   |                                |                                  |                       |

You could select all the data in the `csv` file using the following configuration:

```yaml
filepath: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-data/main/region-metadata.csv
output: '*'
```

## Parameters

### Plugin config

- `filepath` - path to a csv file, either on the local filesystem or on the internet
- `output` - the columns to grab data from and add to output data - should support wildcard or multiple values.

The plugin also supports data renaming. This means you can grab data from a named column but push it into your manifest file data under another name, for example, maybe we want to grab data from the `processor-name` column in the target csv and add it to the manifest file data as `processor-id` because this is the name expected by some other plugin in your piepline. You can do this by passing comma separated values in arrays.

```yaml
output: ['processor-name': 'processor-id']
```

You can nest arrays to do this renaming for multiple columns.

```yaml
output:
  [['processor-name', 'processor-model-id'], ['tdp', 'thermal-design-power']]
```

- `"*"` - indicating all columns should be selected
- `"tdp"` - indicating that only column `tdp` should be selected
- `["processor-name", "processor-model-id"]` - indicating that only column `processor-name` should be selected and output as `processor-model-id`
- `[["processor-name", "processor-model-id"],["tdp", "thermal-design-power"]]` - indicating that the `processor-name` and `tdp` columns should be selected with `processor-name` output as `processor-model-id` and `tdp` as `thermal-design-power`

### Plugin parameter metadata

The `parameter-metadata` section contains information about `description`, `unit` and `aggregation-method` of the parameters of the inputs and outputs

- `inputs`: describe the parameters of the `inputs`. Each parameter has:

  - `description`: description of the parameter
  - `unit`: unit of the parameter
  - `aggregation-method`: aggregation method object of the parameter
    - `time`: this value is used for `horizontal` aggregation. It can be of the following values: `sum`, `avg`, `copy`, or `none`.
    - `component`: this value is used for `vertical` aggregation. It can be of the following values: `sum`, `avg`, `copy`, or `none`.

- `outputs`: describe the parameters in the `output` of the config block. The parameter has the following attributes:
  - `description`: description of the parameter
  - `unit`: unit of the parameter
  - `aggregation-method`: aggregation method object of the parameter
    - `time`: this value is used for `horizontal` aggregation. It can be of the following values: `sum`, `avg`, `copy`, or `none`.
    - `component`: this value is used for `vertical` aggregation. It can be of the following values: `sum`, `avg`, `copy`, or `none`.

### Mapping

The `mapping` block is an optional block. It is added in the plugin section and allows the plugin to receive a parameter from the input with a different name than the one the plugin uses for data manipulation. The parameter with the mapped name will not appear in the outputs. It also maps the output parameter of the plugin. The structure of the `mapping` block is:

```yaml
cloud-metadata:
  method: CSVImport
  path: 'builtin'
  mapping:
    'parameter-name-in-the-plugin': 'parameter-name-in-the-input'
```

### Inputs

There are no strict requirements on input for this plugin because they depend upon the contents of the target CSV and your input data at the time the CSV import is invoked. Please make sure you are requesting data from columns that exist in the target csv file and that your query values are available in your `input` data.

## Returns

The input data with the requested csv content appended to it.

## Plugin logic

1. Validates config which contains `filepath` and `output`.
2. Tries to retrieve given file (with url or local path).
3. Parses given CSV.
4. Filters requested information from CSV.
5. Returns enriched input data

## Implementation

To run the plugin, you must first create an instance of `CSVImport`. Then, you can call `execute()`.

```typescript
const config = {
  filepath: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-data/main/cloud-metdata-aws-instances.csv',
  output: ['cpu-tdp', 'tdp'],
};
const parametersMetadata = {inputs: {}, outputs: {}};
const mapping = {};
const csvImport = CSVImport(config, parametersMetadata, mapping);

const result = await csvImport.execute([
  {
    timestamp: '2023-08-06T00:00'
    duration: 3600
    'cpu/energy': 0.001
    'cloud/provider': gcp
    'cloud/region': asia-east
  },
]);
```

## Example manifest

IF users will typically call the plugin as part of a pipeline defined in a manifest file. In this case, instantiating the plugin is handled by `if` and does not have to be done explicitly by the user. The following is an example manifest that calls `csv-import`:

```yaml
name: csv-import-demo
description:
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
    cloud-metadata:
      method: CSVImport
      path: 'builtin'
      config:
        filepath: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-data/main/region-metadata.csv
        output: '*'
      mapping:
        cloud/region: cloud/area
tree:
  children:
    child:
      pipeline:
        compute:
          - cloud-metadata
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          cloud/provider: Google Cloud
          cloud/area: europe-north1
```

You can run this example by saving it as `./examples/manifests/csv-import.yml` and executing the following command from the project root:

```sh
npm i -g @grnsft/if
if-run --manifest manifests/plugins/csv-import.yml --output manifests/outputs/csv-import
```

The results will be saved to a new `yaml` file in `manifests/outputs`.

## Errors

`CSVImport` exposes five of the IF error classes.

### FetchingFileError

This error is caused by problems finding the file at the path provided in the `filepath`. If the file is on your local filesystem, you can check that the file is definitely there. For a remote file, check your internet connection. You can check your connection to the server using a tool such as `ping` or `curl`. if you still experience problems, you could retrieve the remote file onto your local filesystem using a tool such as `wget`.

### ReadFileError

This error is caused by problems reading the CSV file provided in the `filepath`. To fix it, check that the file contains valid CSV data. The file should have a `.csv` file extension and the data inside should be formatted correctly.

### MissingCSVColumnError

This error is caused by `CsvImport` failing to find a column in the CSV file whose name matches what was provided in `query`. To debug, check that you do not have any typos in your `query` and confirm that the requested column name definitely exists in the target file.

### CSVParseError

This error arises due to problems parsing CSV data into IF. This can occur when the CSV data is incorrectly formatted or contains unexpected characters that IF does not recognize. These errors are expected to be unusual edge cases as incorrectly formatted data will usually be identified during file loading and cause a `ReadFileError`. To debug, check your CSV file for any unexpected formatting or unusual characters.

### ConfigError

You will receive an error starting `ConfigError: ` if you have not provided the expected configuration data in the plugin's `initialize` block.

The required parameters are:

- `filepath`: This must be a path to a csv file
- `output`: this must be a string containing a name or a wildcard character (`"*"`)

You can fix this error by checking you are providing valid values for each parameter in the config.

# Impact Framework OKRs

The OKRs guiding Impact Framework to the end of 2025 are:

- Objective: grow an open source community of developers and users
  - Key result: 30 individual contributors to our repositories by end 2025
  
- Objective 2: get IF integrated into more production systems in real businesses and organizations
  - Key result: 20 case studies added to our `if-db` repository
   
Individual contributors include people pushing code to IF, sharing plugins on [the Explorer](https://explorer.if.greensoftware.foundation), adding case studies or working on our documentation.

Case studies take the form of manifest files with explanatory notes that show IF being used to measure some real software application.

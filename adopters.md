# Adopters

Impact Framework is being used by several major organizations to introspect their software systems, as well as having a thriving open source community.

One adopter we will highlight in this file is Amadeus. They have used IF at a large scale, processing multi-million line manifests covering thousands of production servers. they have built their own tooling stack on top of IF. They kindly provided the following quote:

"At Amadeus, the Impact Framework (IF) has become an essential brick in our software carbon measurement engine. Its scalability provides us with a transparent and robust way to model the energy consumption and carbon emissions of our whole cloud infrastructure. Its open-source nature fosters collaboration and innovation, making it a critical part of our efforts to drive environmental responsibility."

NCS Group Singapore also used IF and various IF plugins to measure the software carbon intensity of their top 5 Azure apps (as reported by Teck Chun Pang, NCS Group, Singapore)

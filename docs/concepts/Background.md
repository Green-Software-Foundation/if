This project has evolved over the two years of the GSF's existence. 

During the development of the SCI, we acknowledged that the biggest blocker to adoption was data regarding the emissions of software components on different platforms and runtimes.

We then launched the sci-data project to help create the data sets required to calculate an SCI score.

After some investigation, the original sci-data team quickly realized that there were several existing data sources, and many more were in development, free open source or private commercial. The future challenge wouldn't be to source them, it would be knowing which data set to use for which use case, how data sets differed in their methodology and interface and when to use one over the other, the pros/cons, and trade-offs.

The project evolved into the sci-guide to document existing data sets, providing guidance for when to use one over another and how to use it to create your own software measurement reports.

Finally, we had enough information, and SCI use cases started to be written. This was a milestone moment.

But now we are in the next evolution, to have software measurement be a mainstream activity. For this to be an industry with thousands of professionals working to decarbonize software, for businesses to grow and thrive in a commercial software measurement ecosystem, we need to formalize software measurement into a discipline with standards and tooling. The SCI Specification is the standard, and the [Impact Engine Framework](Impact%20Engine%20Framework.md) is the tooling.

# Motivation

If you can't measure, you can't improve. Software has many negative environmental **impacts** which we need to optimize, carbon, water, and energy, to name just a few.

Unfortunately, measuring software impact metrics like carbon, water, and energy is complex and nuanced. 

Modern applications are composed of many smaller pieces of software (components) running on different environments, for example, private cloud, public cloud, bare-metal, virtualized, containerized, mobile, laptops, desktops, embedded, and IoT. Many components that make up a typical software application are run on something other than resources you own or control, which makes including the impact of managed services in your measurement especially hard.  

The impacts of software components also vary over time, so as well as understanding **which** components contribute most to the overall impacts, there is also a question of **when** they contribute the most.

Only through a granular analysis of the impacts of your software system can investments in reducing its impact be prioritized and verified. Measurement is the first and most crucial step in greening a software system, and the first step in that process with the [Impact Engine Framework](Impact%20Engine%20Framework.md) is to create an [Impact Graph](Impact%20Graph.md).
